This example demonstrates a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) to evolve a string (candidate solution) to match a target phrase. It starts with a random population of candidate strings and evolves them toward a target phrase. Each generation, the best candidates are selected, combined (crossover), and slightly altered (mutation). Over time, the population converges toward the target, illustrating how evolutionary algorithms solve optimization problems through variation, selection, and inheritance.
